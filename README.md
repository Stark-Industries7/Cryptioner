# Cryptioner

Cryptioner is a simple Python class for encrypting and decrypting strings using a custom encryption key. This project allows users to join and split strings with an encryption key, providing basic encryption and decryption functionalities.

## Features

- Encrypt a string using a custom encryption key.
- Decrypt the string back to its original form using the same encryption key.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Running the Program

1. Clone the repository or download the `cryptioner.py` file.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `cryptioner.py` file.

3. Run the following command to start the program:

    ```sh
    python cryptioner.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a string and an encryption key.

## Usage

When you run the program, it will ask you to enter a string and an encryption key. The program will then encrypt the string using the provided key and display the encrypted string. After that, it will decrypt the string back to its original form and display the decrypted string.

### Example

```sh
------------------------Welcome To Cryptioner------------------------

enter your string : hello

enter your encryption key : *

The encrypted string is : h*e*l*l*o

String after decryption is : hello

Thank you for using Cryptioner!ðŸ˜‰
